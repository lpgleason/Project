### Load Libraries
```{r library}

library(readxl)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tm)
library(NLP)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)

```


### Import MLB Transaction Data
```{r import transaction data}

# Import transaction data from MLB.com
# Downloaded as Excel file - includes all transactions for all months in 2017

transactions16 <- read_excel("Trans2016.xlsx", 
     sheet = "Sheet1")

head(transactions16)

transactions16$Clean <- gsub("[[:space:]]", " ", transactions16$Transaction) 

```

### Filter Transaction Data for Disabled List Transactions
First, we need to filter just for disabled list transactions.
```{r filter for DL transactions}

# Filter just for those transactions that contain the term 'disabled list' - call dataframe new

new_16 <- dplyr::filter(transactions16, grepl('disabled list', Clean))
head(new_16)

```

### Create Variables in Data Frame to Describe the Transactions

```{r type of DL transaction}

# create a new variable for action to reflect what kind of DL action it is
  ## Placed means first instance of player being assigned to DL
  ## Transferred means player was moved from shorter DL list to longer DL list
  ## Activated means player was put back on active roster from DL

new_16$action <- ifelse(grepl("transfer", new_16$Clean, ignore.case = T), "Transferred", 
         ifelse(grepl("place", new_16$Clean, ignore.case = T), "Placed", ifelse(grepl("activate", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =T), "Activated", "Other")))

#make a frequency table of action 
act_count <- plyr::count(new_16, 'action')
act_count

```

```{r player position}

# Create variable for position of player
new_16$position <- ifelse(grepl(" C ", new_16$Clean, ignore.case = F), "Catcher", ifelse(grepl("1B", new_16$Clean, ignore.case = F), "First Baseman", ifelse(grepl("2B", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Second Baseman", ifelse(grepl("3B", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Third Baseman", ifelse(grepl("SS", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Shortstop", ifelse(grepl("RF", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Right Fielder", ifelse(grepl("CF", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Center Fielder", ifelse(grepl("LF", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Left Fielder", ifelse(grepl("RHP", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl("LHP", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl(" P ", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl("DH", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Designated Hitter", ifelse(grepl("OF", new_16$Clean, ignore.case =F), "Outfielder", "Other")))))))))))))

```{r DL length}

#make a frequency table of type of disabled list

```


```{r retroactive DL actions}

# Create new variable to indicate if this DL transaction is a retroactive move?
new_16$retro <- ifelse(grepl("retroactive", new_16$Clean, ignore.case = T), "Yes", "No")

#make a frequency table of action 
retro_count <- plyr::count(new_16, 'retro')
retro_count

```


```{r surgery}
# Create a variable to indicate if surgery is indicated in DL transaction description

#make a frequency table of surgery 
surg_count <- plyr::count(new_16, 'surg')

```

```{r}
# Create variable for concussion involvement

#make a frequency table of action 
tom_count <- plyr::count(new_16, 'tom')
tom_count

```


```{r transaction month}
# create variable for month of transaction - later it will be useful to have this
new_16$month <- format(new_16$Date,"%B")

```

```{r name extraction}

tibs_16 <- tibble(new_name = new_16$Clean) %>%

```{r retroactive date}

## Three chunks of text following "retroactive to"

retro_tib_16 <- tibble(retro_day = new_16$Clean) %>%

## Export data to Excel to bring into Stata and merge with other player stats
```{r}

write.csv(new_16, "/Users/Lacey/Desktop/N741/new_16.csv", row.names=F)

```


## Create word cloud of disabled list descriptions 
Next, let's see if we can make a wordcloud of the disabled list descriptions. 
```{r create DL list}

# remove punctuation 
transactions16$wordcloud <- str_replace_all(transactions16$Clean, pattern = "[:punct:]", "")

DL_lines <- grep("disabled list", transactions16$wordcloud, value = TRUE)
length(DL_lines)
head(DL_lines)
```

```{r wordcloud 1}
# Make wordcloud of words used in disabled list transactions 

wordcloud(VCorpus(VectorSource(DL_lines)), max.words = 15, scale =c(5.5,.4), colors = topo.colors(n=30), random.color = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#Get rid of common words so that word cloud is more interesting
# took out common words like "the" and also word that are part of multiple teams' names 
#(e.g., Los, York, Chicago)

pattern <- "disabled"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern, "", DL_lines)

tail(DL_lines2)
DL_lines2[200:220]

pattern2 <- "list"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern2, "", DL_lines2)

pattern24 <- "disabled "
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern24, "", DL_lines2)
pattern25 <- " disabled"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern25, "", DL_lines2)

wordcloud(VCorpus(VectorSource(DL_lines2)), max.words = 15, scale =c(5.5,.4), colors = topo.colors(n=30), random.color = TRUE)

```

### Next steps

* Finish text analysis
    + Pull out player name
    + Pull out team name

* De-duplicate transaction data so that placements, transfers, and activations for the same player are included in the same row for a single player
    + Calculate time on DL

* Merge baseball reference data on hitter and pitcher stats and characteristics that has already been downloaded
    + Match on multiple characteristics to ensure that player is correct since there are many comon names

* Run logistic regression on 20% sample of data to train

* Use model to predict outcome for the remaining 80% of data
