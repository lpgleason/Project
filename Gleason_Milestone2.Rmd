### Load Libraries
```{r library}

library(readxl)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tm)
library(NLP)

```


### Import MLB Transaction Data
```{r import transaction data}

# Import transaction data from MLB.com
# Downloaded as Excel file - includes all transactions for all months in 2017

transactions <- read_excel("Transactions.xlsx", 
     sheet = "Sheet1")

head(transactions)

```

There were 11,727 MLB transactions during the 12 months of 2017. The imported dataset contains a column of transaction dates and a column of text that describes the transactions. Within this text is the information about team, player name, player position, type of transaction, and type of injury (where applicable for disabled list transactions) that we want to pull out.

### Filter Transaction Data for Disabled List Transactions
First, we need to filter just for disabled list transactions.
```{r filter for DL transactions}

# Filter just for those transactions that contain the term 'disabled list' - call dataframe new

new <- dplyr::filter(transactions, grepl('disabled list', Transaction))
head(new)

```

There were 1,386 MLB transactions in 2017 that involved the disabled list. We would like to know what types of transactions those were.

### Create Variables in Data Frame to Describe the Transactions

```{r type of DL transaction}

# create a new variable for action to reflect what kind of DL action it is
  ## Placed means first instance of player being assigned to DL
  ## Transferred means player was moved from shorter DL list to longer DL list
  ## Activated means player was put back on active roster from DL

new$action <- ifelse(grepl("transfer", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Transferred", 
         ifelse(grepl("place", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Placed", ifelse(grepl("activate", new$Transaction, ignore.case =T), "Activated", "Other")))

#make a frequency table of action 
act_count <- plyr::count(new, 'action')
act_count

```

The proportion of disalbed list actions that were activations was 39.8%. The proportion of disabled list actions that were placements was 52.0%. The proportion of disabled list actions that were transfers was 9.7%. The percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Since there were no "Other" actions in frequency table, we know that we're not missing a DL action other than those listed. 

Next, we'd like to pull out player characteristics from the text.

```{r player position}

# Create variable for position of player
new$position <- ifelse(grepl(" C ", new$Transaction, ignore.case = F), "Catcher", 
         ifelse(grepl("1B", new$Transaction, ignore.case = F), "First Baseman", ifelse(grepl("2B", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Second Baseman", ifelse(grepl("3B", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Third Baseman", ifelse(grepl("SS", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Shortstop", ifelse(grepl("RF", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Right Fielder", ifelse(grepl("CF", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Center Fielder", ifelse(grepl("LF", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Left Fielder", ifelse(grepl("RHP", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl("LHP", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl(" P ", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Pitcher", ifelse(grepl("DH", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Designated Hitter", ifelse(grepl("OF", new$Transaction, ignore.case =F), "Outfielder", "Other")))))))))))))

# Create frequency table of position
pos_count <- plyr::count(new, 'position')
pos_count

```

We see that 55% of the players involved in DL transactions were pitchers. Later, after we de-duplicate the placements, transfers, and activations, we can compare the player type distribution to that of the active players in the league overall in 2017.

Next, we will look at which type of disabled list is utilized in most disabled list transactions. There is a 10-day disabled list, a 60-day disabled list, and a special 7-day disabled list for concussions. There have been some interesting changes to the length of the disabled list over the years (e.g., elimination of 15-day disabled list and re-introduction of 10-day disabled list) to try to nudge teams and players to make the best choices in weighing a player's health and a team's need for the player's on-field contributions. Timing of these policy changes will be kept in mind during this analysis. 

```{r DL length}
# Create a new variable called list that refelcts type of DL referenced in transaction
new$list <- ifelse(grepl("10-day", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "10-day", 
         ifelse(grepl("60-day", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "60-day", ifelse(grepl("7-day", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "7-day", "Other")))

#make a frequency table of type of disabled list
list_count <- plyr::count(new, 'list')
list_count

attach(new)
list_table <- table(list,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
list_table # print table 
prop.table(list_table, 2) # column percentages
```

We see that 85% of the disabled list transactions (90% of placements) involved actions related to the 10-day disabled list. Twelve percent of the DL transactions (6% of placements) involved the 60-day disabled list and 3% of the DL transactions (4% of placements) involved the 7-day disabled list. All of the transfers involved transfers from the 10-day disabled list.

Another important characteristic of DL placements is whether they are retroactive to an earlier date. If a player has not played in up to 5 days, the team can then retroactively place the player on the disabled list and have those days count towards meeting the length requirement of the disabled list. Since teams are protected by being able to retroactively place players on the DL, they tend to list players as day-to-day in case they get better within five days and can avoid having to serve a full ten days on the DL.

```{r retroactive DL actions}

# Create new variable to indicate if this DL transaction is a retroactive move?
new$retro <- ifelse(grepl("retroactive", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Yes", "No")

#make a frequency table of action 
retro_count <- plyr::count(new, 'retro')
retro_count

attach(new)
retro_table <- table(retro,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
retro_table # print table 
prop.table(retro_table, 2) # column percentages

```

Examining the table above, we see that 22% of the DL transactions are retroactive. This represents 43% of DL placements in 2017.

Another interesting component that we want to pull out of this transaction text is information about the injuries precipitating DL transactions. Below, we will look at if surgeries are involved.

```{r surgery}
# Create a variable to indicate if surgery is indicated in DL transaction description
new$surg <- ifelse(grepl("surgery", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Yes", "No")

#make a frequency table of surgery 
surg_count <- plyr::count(new, 'surg')
surg_count

attach(new)
surg_table <- table(surg,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
surg_table # print table 
prop.table(surg_table, 2) # column percentages

```

There were 29 disabled list transactions in 2017 that mentioned surgery. Surgeries were involved in 23 (3%) of DL placements.

Let's look at concussions.

```{r}
# Create variable for concussion involvement
new$concuss <- ifelse(grepl("concussion", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "1", "0")

#make a frequency table of action 
concuss_count <- plyr::count(new, 'concuss')
concuss_count

attach(new)
con_table <- table(concuss,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
con_table # print table 
prop.table(con_table, 2) # column percentages
```

There were 44 disabled list transactions in 2017 that mentioned concussions. Forty (6%) of DL placements involved concussions. This is around the number we would expect since we saw there were 37 instances where the 7-day disabled list was used, which is specfically for concussions.

Next, we will look at which side of the body is involved in the injury.
```{r side of body}
# Create new variable to indicate side of body of injury
new$side <- ifelse(grepl("right", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Right", ifelse(grepl("left", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "Left", "Unknown"))

#make a frequency table of action 
side_count <- plyr::count(new, 'side')
side_count

attach(new)
side_table <- table(side,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
side_table # print table 
prop.table(side_table, 2) # column percentages

```

For those DL placements that included the side of the body involved in the injury, 60% involved the right side of the body. However, 27% of all DL placements did not list side of the body.

Next, let's look at DL transactions that mentioned Tommy John surgery, a common procedure for pitchers.

```{r}
# Tommy John Surgery indicator
new$tom <- ifelse(grepl("Tommy John", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "1", ifelse(grepl(" UCL ", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "1", ifelse(grepl("ulnar collateral", new$Transaction, ignore.case = T), "1", "0")))

#make a frequency table of action 
tom_count <- plyr::count(new, 'tom')
tom_count

attach(new)
tom_table <- table(tom,action) # A will be rows, B will be columns 
tom_table # print table 
prop.table(tom_table, 2) # column percentages

```

Overall, 1.7% of DL placements and 4.5% of DL transfers involve Tommy John surgery.

```{r transaction month}
# create variable for month of transaction - later it will be useful to have this
new$month <- format(new$Date,"%B")

```

## Create word cloud of disabled list descriptions 
Next, let's see if we can make a wordcloud of the disabled list descriptions. 
```{r create DL list}
DL_lines <- grep("disabled list", transactions$Transaction, value = TRUE)
length(DL_lines)
head(DL_lines)
```

```{r wordcloud 1}
# Make wordcloud of words used in disabled list transactions 

wordcloud(VCorpus(VectorSource(DL_lines)), max.words = 15, scale =c(5.5,.4), colors = topo.colors(n=30), random.color = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#Get rid of common words so that word cloud is more interesting
# took out common words like "the" and also word that are part of multiple teams' names 
#(e.g., Los, York, Chicago)

pattern <- "disabled"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern, "", DL_lines)

tail(DL_lines2)
DL_lines2[200:220]

pattern2 <- "list"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern2, "", DL_lines2)
pattern3 <- "Chicago"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern3, "", DL_lines2)
pattern4 <- "San"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern4, "", DL_lines2)
pattern5 <- "Los"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern5, "", DL_lines2)
pattern6 <- "New"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern6, "", DL_lines2)
pattern7 <- " on"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern7, "", DL_lines2)
pattern8 <- " the"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern8, "", DL_lines2)
pattern9 <- "from"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern9, "", DL_lines2)
pattern10 <- " The "
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern10, "", DL_lines2)
pattern11 <- "Angeles"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern11, "", DL_lines2)
pattern12 <- "list."
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern12, "", DL_lines2)
pattern13 <- "2017"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern13, "", DL_lines2)
pattern14 <- "York"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern14, "", DL_lines2)
pattern15 <- "Red"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern15, "", DL_lines2)
pattern16 <- "Blue"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern16, "", DL_lines2)
pattern17 <- "Bay"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern17, "", DL_lines2)
pattern18 <- "to the"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern18, "", DL_lines2)
pattern19 <- " and"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern19, "", DL_lines2)
pattern20 <- "Disabled"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern20, "", DL_lines2)
pattern21 <- "Sox"
DL_lines2 <- sub(pattern21, "", DL_lines2)

wordcloud(VCorpus(VectorSource(DL_lines2)), max.words = 15, scale =c(5.5,.4), colors = topo.colors(n=30), random.color = TRUE)

```

### Next steps

* Finish text analysis
    + Pull out player name
    + Pull out team name

* De-duplicate transaction data so that placements, transfers, and activations for the same player are included in the same row for a single player
    + Calculate time on DL

* Merge baseball reference data on hitter and pitcher stats and characteristics that has already been downloaded
    + Match on multiple characteristics to ensure that player is correct since there are many comon names

* Run logistic regression on 20% sample of data to train

* Use model to predict outcome for the remaining 80% of data
